The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes cause unexpected behavior if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit usage. For example, attempting to subtract a percentage value directly from a pixel value might not work as intended.  Another common mistake is forgetting to leave a space between operators and values inside `calc()` resulting in errors.
